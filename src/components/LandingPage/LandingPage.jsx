          <p>
            Here at The Game Exchange, we know that regardless of how much you treasure your game collection,
            there's always some outliers that you just dont play anymore. Maybe you've even set aside a dark corner
            of closet to store such games, and have forget what all is back there.
          </p>

          <p>
            We would like to provide a platform to not only catalog all your games, but also get excess games out of your closet,
            and exchange them for games you'll get more playtime out of.
          </p>
