# The Game Exchange  
If you have a hobby of playing board games, you may have run into a similar problem as me. Collections get unwieldy quickly. As proud as I am of my shelves full of my favorite games, there is always a stack hiding in a dark corner of a closet. The goal of The Game Exchange is to create a platform for users to keep track of the games they have laying in various places around the house, and list them for trade when they decide it;s time to part ways with them.
## Setting Up An Account    
The App is currently deployed on heroku, and can be found here [https://thegameexchange.herokuapp.com/](https://thegameexchange.herokuapp.com/)  
To create an account, simply register with a username, and an email. Keep in mind, the email you provide is the only point of contact for other users to reach you.  

## Using the App  

After you create an account, you will be directed to the home page. Here, you will see a list of games that people has specified are games they like it trade in exchange for something else.
