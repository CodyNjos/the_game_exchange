# The Game Exchange  
If you have a hobby of playing board games, you may have run into a similar problem as me. Collections get unwieldy quickly. As proud as I am of my shelves full of my favorite games, there is always a stack hiding in a dark corner of a closet. The goal of The Game Exchange is to create a platform for users to keep track of the games they have laying in various places around the house, and list them for trade when they decide it;s time to part ways with them.
